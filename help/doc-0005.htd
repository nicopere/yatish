The <A HREF="doc-0023.htm">menu bar</A> provides access to most of <I>yatish</I> commands, except for the <A HREF="doc-0007.htm#shift">SHIFT commands</A> of panel #2. Furthermore some commands from the <B>Edit</B> menu are also provided in <A HREF="doc-0024.htm">context menus</A> (only in panel #2).<P>
Apart from the mouse, one can navigate the menus with the usual ALT mechanism (checkout underlined letters when pressing the ALT key). There are also <A HREF="doc-0025.htm">keyboard shortcuts</A> for some common tasks. These shortcuts are mentionned in menu subtitles and it's worth remembering them; they begin with CTRL except for F1 (which spawns the present help).
