You should first defines the clients you are working for. Actually the concept of a "client" can be tweaked to designate your own business if your spend some time investing on R&D, your employer if you are a homeworker, or even nothing if you record the time spent on, say, a model making hobby project.<P>
For the later case just create an empty record in the <I>client</I> table. You will then be able to select that "nobody client" when <A HREF="doc-0011.htm">creating a project</A>. Actually you can also use empty records in the <I>task</I> and <I>tool</I> tables described below, but you will then miss several usefull reporting capabilities of <I>yatish</I>.<P>
A "task" is a recurring kind of activity, meaning that it might be relevant to different <A HREF="doc-0012.htm">activities</A>. For instance, a "development" task can typically be found in different IT projects. The same applies to the "tool" concept, which also allows you to document the various activities you are involved in; going on with the IT project example, a "tool" might be a programming langage, a software suite, a web conferencing service, etc.<P>
The <I>client</I>, <I>task</I> or <I>tool</I> records are quite simple (just one <I>name</I> field): the dialog used to create/modify them is described <A HREF="doc-0015.htm">here</A>.
