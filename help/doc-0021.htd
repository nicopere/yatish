An important feature of <I>yatish</I> is its ability to connect to a MySQL/MariaDB server. One can use this functionality to:
<UL>
<LI>backup data;
<LI>synchronise devices if working on several ones;
<LI>provide willingfull access to your data (a <U>reader</U> version of <I>yatish</I> will be provided in the future).
</UL><P>
But then you must of course provide credentials. On a Linux system <I>yatish</I> expects to find a <TT>yatish.auth</TT> file in your <TT>~/.yatish</TT> directory (where your <I>yatish</I> database and settings are also stored). Check that you alone have read/write access to this file! (<TT>chmod 600</TT> on Linux)<P>
The <TT>yatish.auth</TT> must follow this template
(which is also provided in <TT>/usr/local/share/yatish/</TT> on Linux):
<PRE>
[MySQL]
server=xxx   #domain name or IP address
database=yyy #yatish database
user=zzz     #MySQL/MariaDB user
password=***
