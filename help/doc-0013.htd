Switch to panel #2 to view the contents of the various tables. We have already used this panel to initialize <I>yatish</I> but afterwards it is mainly useful to compute the total and average durations of (a selection of) recorded timeslots (checkout the <A HREF="doc-0008.htm">status bar</A>). From time to time, you will also use this view to correct a mistyped record.
