Once you have defined at least one client, project, task and tool, panel #1 is operational and you can select a combination of project, task and tool. Such a combination is know to <I>yatish</I> as an "activity". If the chosen activity does not exist in the <I>activity</I> table, <I>yatish</I> will create one for you when you press the RECORD button, which has several other consequences:
<UL>
<LI>a new record is created in the <I>timeslot</I> table; the current timestamp is written in the <I>start</I> field;
<LI>the (RECORD) STOP button is (de)activated;
<LI>the status bar clock begins to tick;
<LI>the <I>yatish</I> icon is changed (however <A HREF="doc-0501.htm">check this</A>).
</UL>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="img/yatish_recording.png" ALIGN="TEXTTOP"></CENTER><P>
Pressing the STOP button reverses these effects:
<UL>
<LI>the <I>timeslot</I> record is updated: the current timestamp is written in the <I>stop</I> field;
<LI>the (STOP) RECORD button is (de)activated;
<LI>the status bar clock is frozen;
<LI>the <I>yatish</I> icon is reset.
</UL>

N.B. <I>yatish</I> will behave as if you had pressed the STOP button if you exit (CTRL-Q) before.
