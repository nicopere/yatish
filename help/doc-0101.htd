The <A HREF="doc-0401.htm">menu bar</A> provides access to most of <I>yatish</I> commands, except for the <A HREF="doc-0103.htm#shift">SHIFT commands</A> of panel #2. Furthermore some commands from the <B>Time</B> and <B>Edit</B> menus are also provided by <A HREF="doc-0402.htm">context menus</A> in panels #2 and #3.<P>
Apart from the mouse, one can navigate the menus with the usual ALT mechanism (checkout underlined letters when pressing the ALT key). There are also <A HREF="doc-0403.htm">keyboard shortcuts</A> for some common tasks. These shortcuts are mentionned in menu subtitles and it's worth remembering them; they begin with CTRL except for F1 (which spawns the present help).
