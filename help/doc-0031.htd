The standard Linux installation (<TT>.deb</TT> package) raises an issue on Ubuntu (18.04 LTS): the desktop icon is not updated, as should be when one clicks on RECORD (panel #1).<P>
There is a trick, however, to recover this feature:<BR>
delete <TT>/usr/share/applications/yatish.desktop</TT><BR>
(or move it somewhere else in case you change your mind later on).<P>
Yatish will then disappear from the Activities view (Super key) but you can still start it easily by typing <TT>yatish</TT> after ALT-F2.<P>
N.B.  The problem does not happen with Lubuntu (18.04 LTS).
